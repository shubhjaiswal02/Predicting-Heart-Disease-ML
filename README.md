# Heart Disease Prediction Model

This repository contains a predictive Machine Learning model for heart disease detection. The model has been developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It utilizes a dataset of 300+ samples for model training and validation. The project also includes data visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to highlight patterns and correlations. Two algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and Random Forest technique, were employed for model comparison, achieving accuracy rates of 84.5% and 83% respectively.
